# Flashcard Study Tool Project 2

This project enhances the previous flashcard study tool by incorporating machine learning for sentiment analysis. 
Users can choose between a simple self-report evaluation or an ML-based evaluation to determine the sentiment of their answers. 
The program supports various flashcard decks, offers interactive study sessions, and includes the ability to highlight and confirm study results, providing an efficient tool for self-assessment and learning.
